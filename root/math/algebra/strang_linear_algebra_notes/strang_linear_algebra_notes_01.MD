Vector addition v + w and linear combinations cv + dw. 

DEFINITION The sum of cv and dw is a linear combination of v and w.

DEFINITION The dot product or inner product of v = (v1,v2) and w = (w1,w2) is the number v*w = v1w1 + v2w2

A = LU
When a row of A starts with zeros, so does that row of L. 
When a column of A starts with zeros, so does that column of V.
