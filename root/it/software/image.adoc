The other day I got ImageMagick to work in my Drupal environment, but only after hours of trial and error.

I thought I would share my experience in order to help others who might face similar problems.

I am running Drupal 6.19 on a UNIX (FreeBSD 8.1) VPS with root access via SSH. My PHP Version is 5.3.2.

My reasons for using ImageMagick:

1. I want to use the Image Gallery module for a JPEG photo album.

2. I cannot enable the module ImageAPI GD2 because "PHP GD was not compiled with jpeg support. (Currently using GD Jpeg Support Not installed)‚Äù. I was not comfortable with recompiling PHP, so I thought I'd try ImageMagick instead.

My Steps

1) Downloaded the ImageMagick tarball (version 6.6.6-5) from ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/ImageMagick.tar.gz and extracted it to /root/ImageMagick-6.6.6-5.

2) Followed the install steps in http://imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php#unix, i.e.:


$ cd ImageMagick-6.6.6-5
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
$ /usr/local/bin/convert logo: logo.gif
$ make check

I proceeded through all the install steps successfully, but when I went back to Drupal, I found that the ImageMagick convert process did not work for either JPG or PNG files.

When I tried to run convert from the command line, e.g., $ convert test.jpg -flip test.jpg, the following error message was returned:

convert: no decode delegate for this image format `test.jpg' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/532.

This is when I discovered that I needed to have JPEG (and PNG) delegate libraries in place, BEFORE running ./configure.

Had I read the Install-unix.txt file first I would have known this.

The libraries are available from a few sources, but the best are:

The Independent JPEG Group : http://www.ijg.org/
The LibPNG Reference Library : http://libpng.sourceforge.net/
3) So next step was to install the Delegates

I downloaded and extracted the jpegsrc.v8b.tar.gz and libpng-1.4.5.tar.gz tarballs to /usr/local/src. I then closely followed their respective install instructions (install.txt).

4) Next I reinstalled ImageMagick, but this time I followed the advanced instructions at:

http://imagemagick.org/script/advanced-unix-installation.php

Before installing I ran:

$ make uninstall
$ make clean

After some trial and error, I found that I needed to tell the configure script EXACTLY where to find the delegate libraries and headers. All this is documented, albeit generically, in the advanced ImageMagick instructions.

In the end, my configure script looked like this:

$ ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib' --enable-shared --disable-static --without-perl --with-png --with-tiff --with-jpeg

The parameters the I believe were essential to success were:

CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib'
