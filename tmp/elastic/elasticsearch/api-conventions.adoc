The elasticsearch REST APIs are exposed using JSON over HTTP.

== Multiple Indices

 support wildcards, for example: test*

 ignore_unavailable

allow_no_indices

 expand_wildcards


If none is specified then wildcard expansion will be disabled and if all is specified, wildcard expressions will expand to all indices (this is equivalent to specifying open,closed).
