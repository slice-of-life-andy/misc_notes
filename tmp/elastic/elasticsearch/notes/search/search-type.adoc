There are different execution paths that can be done when executing a distributed search.

query_then_fetch:
1. the query is forwarded to all involved shards
2. requests the document content from only the relevant shards

dfs_query_then_fetch
Same as "Query Then Fetch", except for an initial scatter phase which goes and computes the distributed term frequencies for more accurate scoring.

cout 
return the count matched the search query,without any docs 

scan 
no scoring, efficient
